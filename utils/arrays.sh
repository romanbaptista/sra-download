# Ordered list of module scripts that comprise the sra-download pipeline.

#   - Used by preflight_scripts.sh to verify existence, content, and executability.

#     infrastructure (run_pipeline, pipeline, preflight, utils).
#
# Notes:
#   - Tool-specific binaries are intentionally excluded and validated 
#     by dedicated tool preflight scripts.
